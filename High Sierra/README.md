#Mac OS lion theme for MacOS High Sierra

This is a theme to make newer macOS look more like Mountain lion and below.
It uses official assets from Mountain lion

##Some Issues:
Some buttons look off. ex: ![example of an off looking button](https://i.imgur.com/GFuejSH.png)
Some toolbar buttons aren't themed. ex: ![Un themed toolbar](https://i.imgur.com/aEUCcTl.png)





########note: I own none of these assets, I'm only using them. Credits go to apple.
